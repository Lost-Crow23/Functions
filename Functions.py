# functions best practices

# 1. Name your methods using lowercase and underscores
# 2. all arguments should be clear in their need and where possible and their expected type
# 3. remember the return statement or your function will return none in most cases
# 4. Keep your functions small as possible, and keep them readable
# 5. Use comments within your methods to help with instructions on how to use them.
# 6. Consider using Type Hints to avoid errors earlier
